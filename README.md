# 👕 ReWear-Odoo — Sustainable Fashion Exchange Platform

**ReWear** is a web-based platform that promotes sustainable fashion by allowing users to exchange unused clothes through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to reduce textile waste, encourage circular fashion practices, and build a community of conscious consumers.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the increasing impact of fast fashion, millions of wearable garments are discarded annually. This contributes to environmental harm, landfill overflow, and waste of resources. Despite having reusable clothing, many people lack an easy and trustworthy platform to exchange them.

**ReWear-Odoo** addresses this by creating an intuitive platform where users can:
- Swap clothes directly with other users.
- Redeem points earned from listed items to claim other products.
- Reduce textile waste and embrace sustainable living.
